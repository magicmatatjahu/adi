# ADI.JS

## TODO

- rething API for `inject` method and order of arguments, maybe dep should be first or second
// - sort all hooks in creating definitions
- create from `Injectable definition` on class level something like reflection for everything.
- make something like `reflection-metadata` library but only for ADI
- connect instance's `links` as session, not instances
