# ADI.JS

## TODO

- make something like `reflection-metadata` library but only for ADI
- connect instance's `links` as session, not instances
- add events like in v2
- links sessions in inline function resolver to some session (as children) to destroy created (maybe) instances in the resolver function to avoid stack overflow 
- retrieve hooks from InjectionToken and InjectableDefinition and concat it with hooks from provider definition
